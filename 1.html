<p>“<strong><u>Confession</u></strong> cleans the sinner's soul, <strong>it doesn't help the victim</strong>. Our whole church is in need of forgiveness. Where is our humility? Sin is a wound, not a stain. It needs to be treated, healed. Forgiveness is not enough.”</p>
<p>“- <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" target="-blank" title="베네딕트 교황">Pope Benedict</a></strong>: You talk about walls as if they are bad things. A house is built of walls. Strong walls.<br>- <strong>Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio</strong>: Ah... Did Jesus build walls? His face is a face of mercy. The bigger the sinner, the warmer the welcome. Mercy is the dynamite that blows down walls.”</p>
